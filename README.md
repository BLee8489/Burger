YOUR TASK: 
You will create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

INSTALLATION: 
MySQL, Express, Handlebars - npm install mysql, npm install express, npm install express-handlebars

USAGE: 
Javascript, Node, MySQL, Express, Handlebars, MySQLWorkbench, CSS, Bootstrap, Postman, HTML 

TEST INSTRUCTIONS: 
When running node server.js, it should open up your Eat-The-Burger App on local host, and the user will be able to add a burger, which then gets added to the "Burger Options". When you click "Devour it!" it should then go to the "Devoured" section on the right side of the page. You can delete it, if you wish.
